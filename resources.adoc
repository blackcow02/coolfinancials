This document contains references to books, articles, and posts that may (or may not) serve as useful references, guides, supplements, etc. in the following pursuits:

* Better understanding transformative development concepts like Cloud Native architectures, microservices, etc.
* Obtaining a fuller understanding of Cost/Benefit Analysis, Return On Investment (ROI), and other financial concepts/formulas like Payback, Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and Net Present Value (NPV)
* Foster ideas with regard to how to apply financial analysis to transformative development technologies
* Create better evaluations of technologies and their application(s) within your environment
* Document and "make your case" better for technologies under consideration using a fact-based approach, deriving sensible values from qualitative measures

These concepts are explained in a lively presentation by Mark Heckler, available for conferences upon request (schedule permitting).
